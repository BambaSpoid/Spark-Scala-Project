# Spark-Scala-Project
This project consists of using Apache Spark to analyze and process San Francisco Fire Department Calls data in order to provide some KPIs (Key Performance Indicator).

Fire Calls-For-Service includes all fire units responses to calls. Each record includes the call number, incident number, address, unit identifier, call type, and disposition. All relevant time intervals are also included. Because this dataset is based on responses, and since most calls involved multiple units, there are multiple records for each call number. Addresses are associated with a block number, intersection or call box, not a specific address.
